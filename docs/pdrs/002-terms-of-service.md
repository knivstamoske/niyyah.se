# 002 - Terms of Service

- Date: 2025-12-07

## Context

As a platform facilitating marriage introductions, we need clear terms of service that define user rights, responsibilities, and limitations. These terms must protect both the platform and users while maintaining the Islamic values and Swedish legal framework we operate within. The terms must address eligibility, account management, user conduct, liability, and intellectual property while keeping the service accessible and free.

## Decision

We will implement terms of service with the following key provisions:

### Eligibility and Account Requirements

- Users must be legally eligible to marry according to both Swedish law (minimum 18 years) and Islamic principles
- One account per person - multiple accounts are prohibited
- Service only available to individuals who are currently unmarried (single, divorced, or widowed)
- Married individuals must immediately deactivate or delete their accounts
- Users must provide accurate information about themselves and their guardians
- Guardians must have legitimate authority according to Islamic principles
- Users must be acting in good faith to seek marriage

### User Conduct

- Strict enforcement of appropriate behavior to ensure user safety
- Prohibited activities include:
  - Harassment, abuse, or threatening behavior toward any user
  - Providing false, misleading, or fraudulent information
  - Impersonating another person
  - Using the platform for commercial purposes or solicitation
  - Sharing inappropriate content (explicit, offensive, or irrelevant material)
  - Attempting to contact users outside the approved matching process
  - Bypassing guardian involvement when required
  - Creating accounts for others without authorization
  - Collecting or storing other users' personal information
  - Using automated tools or bots to access the platform
- Users must respect the privacy and dignity of others
- Users must maintain appropriate Islamic etiquette (adab) in all interactions

### Service Nature and Limitations

- Niyyah is a facilitator only - we connect users but do not guarantee outcomes
- The platform does not verify user information beyond basic checks
- Guardian relationships are verified through user-provided information only
- Facilitators are volunteers who assist in arranging meetings
- The service is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind
- We are not responsible for:
  - The accuracy of user-provided information
  - The outcome of any introductions or marriages
  - User interactions outside the platform
  - Actions or conduct of facilitators, guardians, or other users
  - Compatibility assessments or match quality

### Service Availability and Changes

- Service is currently free of charge with no fees
- We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the service at any time
- We reserve the right to change these terms with notice to users
- Material changes will be communicated through the platform and email
- Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of new terms

### Account Termination

- Users can delete their accounts at any time through the platform
- We may suspend or terminate accounts for:
  - Violation of these terms of service
  - Violation of privacy policy
  - Providing false information
  - Inappropriate conduct
  - Legal or regulatory requirements
  - Extended inactivity (per privacy policy)
- Terminated users may not create new accounts without permission
- Upon termination, user data is handled according to the privacy policy

### Intellectual Property

- Users retain ownership of content they submit (profiles, photos, messages)
- By submitting content, users grant Niyyah a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to:
  - Store, display, and transmit content as necessary to provide the service
  - Show content to matched users, facilitators, and guardians as appropriate
  - Make technical copies for backup and service operation
- Users must have rights to all content they submit
- Users must not submit copyrighted material without authorization
- Platform name, logo, and design are property of Niyyah
- Users may not use platform branding without written permission

### Governing Law

- These terms are governed by Swedish law
- Service operates according to Swedish legal framework
- Platform adheres to Islamic principles in design and operation

### User Responsibilities

- Provide accurate, current, and complete information
- Maintain confidentiality of account credentials
- Notify us immediately of unauthorized account access
- Comply with all applicable laws and regulations
- Respect Islamic values and principles
- Participate in good faith with genuine intention to marry
- Involve appropriate guardians according to Islamic requirements

### Communications

- Users agree to receive service-related communications via email
- Essential notifications about account, matches, and policy changes
- No marketing or promotional communications (platform is non-commercial)
- Users can manage communication preferences in account settings

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear boundaries protect both users and the platform
- Strict conduct policies create a safer environment
- Transparency builds trust with users
- One account per person prevents abuse
- Free service removes financial barriers to finding a spouse
- Islamic values integrated throughout terms
- User-owned content respects dignity while allowing service operation
- Clear liability limitations protect the platform legally

### Negative

- Strict enforcement requires resources and moderation effort
- Volunteer facilitator model may limit service scalability
- Limited verification may allow some fraudulent accounts
- One account policy requires enforcement mechanisms
- Free service limits future monetization options
- "As is" provision may concern some users
- Lack of compatibility guarantees may lead to user disappointment

### Trade-offs

- We prioritize user safety over rapid growth
- We accept volunteer overhead to keep service free
- We trust users to provide accurate guardian information rather than implementing complex verification
- We allow broad content usage to operate the service while respecting user ownership
- Terms can be updated as the service evolves (e.g., facilitator compensation, dispute resolution)
- Simple verification process balances accessibility with fraud prevention
